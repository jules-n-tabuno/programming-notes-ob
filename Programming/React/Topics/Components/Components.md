==**Components are the building blocks of React applications.** They are reusable pieces of UI that encapsulate specific functionality and can be composed to create complex user interfaces.==

**Key characteristics of React components:**

- **Self-contained:** Components manage their own state and behavior, making them independent and reusable.  
    
- **Composable:** Components can be nested within other components, creating a hierarchical structure.  
    
- **Declarative:** Components describe the desired UI state, and React takes care of updating the DOM efficiently.  
    

**Types of Components:**

1. **[[Functional Components]]s:**
    
    - Simpler and more concise to write.
    - Use hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects.
    - Ideal for presentational components that don't require complex logic.  
        
2. **Class Components:**
    
    - More complex but provide more control over the component lifecycle.
    - Use class-based syntax with methods like `render`, `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, etc.
    - While still usable, functional components with hooks are often preferred for most use cases.
