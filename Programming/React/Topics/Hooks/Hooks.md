==Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without writing class components. They provide a way to reuse stateful logic between different components, making your code more concise, reusable, and easier to understand.==

**Key Benefits of Hooks:**

- **Simplified State Management:** Hooks like `useState` and `useReducer` make it easier to manage state within functional components.
- **Custom Hooks:** You can create custom hooks to encapsulate reusable stateful logic, promoting code modularity and reusability.
- **Improved Code Organization:** Hooks can help you organize your code into smaller, focused functions, making it more readable and maintainable.
- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Hooks eliminate the need for class components and their associated boilerplate code.

**Commonly Used Built-in Hooks:**

1. **[[useState]]:**
    
    - Allows you to add state to functional components.
    - Returns an array with two elements:
        - The current state value
        - A function to update the state
2. **[[useEffect]]:**
    
    - Performs side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, and manual DOM manipulations.
    - Takes two arguments:
        - A function that contains the side effect logic
        - An optional dependency array to control when the effect runs
3. **[[useRef]]:**
    
    - Creates a mutable reference object that persists across re-renders.
    - Often used to access DOM elements, store values that don't trigger re-renders, or create mutable variables.
