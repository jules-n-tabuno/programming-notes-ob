==Handling events in React is done using camelCase syntax. The most commonly used events include onClick, onChange, and onBlur, which allow developers to execute code in response to user interactions. Effective event handling is key to creating responsive applications.==

### 1. [[onClick]]
- In React, the `onClick` event handler is used to execute a function when an element is clicked. You assign it to an element, like a button, and pass a function that will run when the click occurs. This function can be defined inline or separately.
### 2. [[onBlur]]
### 3. [[onChange]]
- In React, the `onChange` event handler is a crucial tool for managing user input in form elements. It triggers whenever the value of an input element changes, allowing you to capture and update state or perform other actions based on the user's input.
